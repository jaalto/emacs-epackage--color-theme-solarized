 BUG REPORTING
 .
 * include the output of M-x version in your report,
 * mention whether you’re using color-theme or the Emacs 24 theme,
 * include the names of Emacs faces that you have a problem with (M-:
   (face-at-point) and M-x describe-face will tell you the name of the face
   at point),
 * include the output of M-: (display-color-cells) (that lets us know which
   set of colors your Emacs is using),
 * screenshots are very helpful (before and after if you made a change),
 * if you’re using a terminal, the name of the terminal and (if you can find
   out) the number of colors the terminal app is using,
 * also if you’re using a terminal, try running Emacs in GUI mode, and see if
   the problem exists there (if it does, report the bug that way, if not,
   just mention that it’s a terminal-only bug),
 * it’s very helpful (but not expected) if you can compare it to a similar
   situation in VIM (especially if you know the VIM highlight name or have a
   screenshot), and
 * M-x customize-apropos-faces can help you find all the relevant faces if
   you are submitting faces for a mode.

 IMPORTANT NOTE FOR TERMINAL USERS by Ethan Schoonover:
 .
 If you are going to use Solarized in Terminal mode (i.e. not in a GUI
 version like Cocoa or X11 Emacs), please please please consider setting
 your terminal emulator's colorscheme to use the Solarized palette. The
 Solarized repository <https://github.com/altercation/solarized> includes
 palettes for some popular terminal emulator as well as Xdefaults; or you
 can download them from the official Solarized homepage
 <http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized>. If you use this emacs color theme
 without having changed your emulator's palette, you will need to configure
 Solarized to degrade its colorscheme to a set compatible with the
 terminal's default limited 256 color palette (whereas by using the
 terminal's 16 ANSI color values, you would see the correct, specific
 values for the Solarized palette).
 .
 If you do use the custom terminal colors, i.e. the 16 overridden ANSI color
 values, the emacs colorscheme should work out of the box for you. If you
 are using a terminal emulator that supports 256 colors and don't want to
 use the custom Solarized terminal colors, you will need to use the
 degraded 256 colorscheme. To do so, simply customize the
 solarized-termcolor variable to 256.
 .
 Again, I recommend just changing your terminal colors to Solarized values
 either manually or via one of the many terminal schemes available for
 import.
